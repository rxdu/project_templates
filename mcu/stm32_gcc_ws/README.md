# STM32 GCC Workspace Template

## How to use the template

1. Create a new project in src/targets, use "racer_core" as an example

## Known limitations

* Only STM32F1/F4 targets are tested. However it should be easy to add support for other Cortex-M MCUs with minor modifications.
* ST-Link support to be added.
