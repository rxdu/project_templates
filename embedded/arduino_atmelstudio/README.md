Arduino sketch for automatic cooker

####1.Project configuration of Atmel Studio for Arduino

In branch *rdu\_ctrl\_avr* , there are two folders: *AutomaticCooker* and *Dependencies*. The first one is basically the project folder created by Atmel Studio 6.2. The second one is mainly copied from the Arduino IDE folder, which includes the headers and source files of core and other additional libraries. It also includes \*.a files which are the compiled core library generated by Arduino IDE. All dependencies are gathered into this folder so you will be able to compile the project directly without any further configuration.

However, if you want to use *avrdude.exe* to write the compiled .hex file to the microcontroller. You will need to follow the following steps:

######a. In Atmel Studio, click "Tools"-"External Tools...". 

######b. In the opened dialog window, add a new tool with the following properties:

- **Title**: ArduinoUno or whatever you like
- **Commands:** navigate to avrdude.exe placed in ".\Dependencies\arduino-1.0.5-r2-windows\hardware\tools\avrdude\avrdude.exe" and the IDE will get the full path for you. 
	For example, you might have "E:\My Projects\Project Code\GitHub\AutomaticCooker\Dependencies\arduino-1.0.5-r2-windows\hardware\tools\avrdude\avrdude.exe".
- **Arguments**: -C $(ProjectDir)avrdude.conf -v -v -patmega328p -carduino -P\\.\COM4 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:"$(ProjectDir)Debug\AutomaticCooker.hex":i

    _**Change  COM number and baud rate**_  according to your specific hardware configuration 
- **Initial directory**: leave blank
- Check "Use Output window" so that you can see the flashing info in the Output Window of the IDE

After these two steps, you will be able to flash your code to the MCU.
